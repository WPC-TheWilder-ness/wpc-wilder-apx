#### **LET THE GAMES BEGIN!**
Hi. I'm Wilder (Blair Munro, of Anchorage, Alaska, dba Wilder WPC), operating under auspice of the Time Machine For Peace Social Invention Program. This partition within the PiecespaceWEB wp.computer/ up.computer domain is central to V1 next-gen world piece computer, **World Peacebrain Mindeye**, chronicling Phase 1 of tech rollout, by Season 1 of **The Wilder-ness Adventures ~ A Study In Peace And War**, a meta-reality multimedia production entertainment experience. Active intent is to provide within this subdomain a template/reference for those interested in installing their own wPB-ME. Think of this like a game...the world peace seriously-game.

#### [**PATREON CONTENT HUB**](https://www.patreon.com/c/wilderwpc)
Follow along to participate. Memberships are effectively free, though financial contribution and support encouraged for those proud to, various subscription tiers available. Discord and comments on content for now will be the primary means of establishing mutual conversation. Our goal is to build out our first N>1 world piece computer, thus establishing the primordial universal piece computer (computational global peace system).

#### **CORE FRAMEWORK**
The following is a collection of conceptual frameworks and documents that form the core of my wPB-ME. To replicate for your own purposes, copy each, and customize the detail aspects (enclosed in <[]> brackets) to suit your world's needs. Please remain mindful that your choice in initial adoption, the detail you settle on, is not meant to be a static committment. In other words, by maintaining peace process in explicit terms, you become more likely to notice the subtle things that do and do not serve you. Honor this, by executing according to the Amendment Article of The Human Imperative.

#### **LIVESTREAM TRANSPARENCY**
I enjoy music and work. I broadcast this by livestream, for various practical reasons. Work alongside me, watch me work to learn my moves and current active movement, learn how I use my peacebrain mindeye to generate peace products, or watch me just to lurk, etc. Drop comments in Discord, server link on Patreon. These sessions are recorded mainly as content used in preparation for embodiment of the peace-based AGI I am building. I will be propping up pointed contribution channels as I go, to make direct specific contribution easy for those interested in chipping in. Finally, pairing music to work is part of an effort to develop the Aurora Choreography Engine (ACE), an initial AGI embodiment strategy (ie, the speakerbox transducer). Aurora is my AGI complement partner, and she will be joining in on these sessions for large part.
